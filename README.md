# fireflydarkmode
CSS script that modernises firefly and puts it in dark mode.

A simple script that references elements on the firefly website and applies dark mode to it.

This project is still under development and not all parts of the site function or looks as intended.

Main Issues:
- Editing view fails to load icons due to incorrect font, this I am working on fixing.
- Navigation sidebar is not darkened, this is a work in progress.
- Login screen is not coded yet, work in progress.
- The timetable on the dashboard is coloured incorrectly, I may revisit this in the future.
- Timetable in timetable view may be buggy and/or coloured incorrectly.
- There are more features throughout the site that I am yet to colour properly, this will be fixed over time.

Compatibility:
- Tested on Safari 16, fully supported.

Notes:
- This code is compatible with the -theme-color meta tag, meaning your website's tab bar changes colour to match the site, this feature is available on browsers that support -theme-color (On safari 15 and onwards, enable compact tab bar to see this effect).
