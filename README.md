# fireflydarkmode
CSS script that modernises firefly and puts it in dark mode.

Simple script that refferences elements on the firefly website and applies dark mode to it.

This project is still under development and not all parts of the site function or look as intended.

Main Issues:
- Editing view fails to load icons due to incorrect font, this I am working on fixing.
- Navigation sidebar not darkened, this is a work in progress.
- Timetable on dashboard is coloured incorrectly, I may revisit this in the future.
- Timetable in timetable view may be buggy and/or coloured incorrectly.
- There are more features throughout the site that I am yet to colour properly, this will be fixed over time.
